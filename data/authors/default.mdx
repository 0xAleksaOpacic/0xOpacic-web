Hello!

I'm based in Belgrade, Serbia. I graduated with a degree in software engineering from the University of Belgrade School of Electrical Engineering.

My professional journey began as a full-stack engineer, but as time went on, I found my niche in blockchain protocol development.

Outside of coding, I frequently attend conferences to keep up with the latest in tech.


# Work Experience
## =nil; Foundation
**Position:** Integration Software Engineer

## Polygon Edge (Go)
**Position:** Senior Blockchain Protocol Engineer

Polygon Edge isn’t another Ethereum client or fork of GETH—it's an open-source tool for starting EVM networks (L1, L2, Appchains). We had to create its core EVM modules entirely from scratch. My work included designing new parts, fixing issues, cleaning up the code, and making sure our code was top-notch

### Key Achievements:
- Contributed to core EVM blockchain modules including jsonrpc, consensus, mempool, syncer, engine, state, and network
- Designed a new node syncing protocol that drastically reduced GRPC calls needed to sync 1M blocks from ~10500 to 2, subsequently decreasing the time required to sync 1M blocks by ~10min
- Added support for multiple consensus protocols (POA, POS) and different signing algorithms (BLS, ECDSA)
- Led technical meetings with 30+ Polygon Edge clients
- Took initiative in improving Polygon Edge documentation and onboarding materials, enhancing the user experience and product adoption

## Lava Network (Go/Typescript)

**Position:** Senior Protocol Engineer

I contribute in the development and maintenance of the Lava protocol. I implemented a variety of consumer strategies for Lava, allowing user-customizable preferences for speed, accuracy, or a balanced approach. Also I drove the development of the Lava-SDK TypeScript library, providing decentralized access to blockchain networks through the Lava Protocol

### Key Achievements:
- Conducted comprehensive codebase audits, identifying potential issues and implementing effective resolutions
- Enhanced Lava providers through refactoring, allowing one provider to support multiple networks and multiple API interfaces simultaneously
- Successfully facilitated the functionality of Lava SDK on both browser and node environments, utilizing grpc-web for effective communication with providers
- Developed the Lava Ethers Provider, an innovative take on ethers.js providers, enabling existing DApps that use ethers.js to have the benefits of decentralized access when they switch to the Lava Ethers Provider
