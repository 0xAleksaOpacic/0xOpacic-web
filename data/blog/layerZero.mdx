## Introduction

At the time of writing this article, the blockchain ecosystem resembles the Wild West. Blockchain networks are popping up left and right, from new L1s to L2s, app-chains â€” you name it, and someone is probably working on it. One thing is sure: for the time being, we need a reliable and secure way of transferring arbitrary data from one chain to another.

A few months ago, i came accross an [article](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/25/bridge-protocol-layerzero-passes-50m-cross-chain-messages/) stating that LayerZero just passed 50M cross-chain messages just 3 months after they [raised 120M](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/04/crypto-protocol-layerzero-raises-120m-series-b-at-3b-valuation/?_gl=1*kuqhfq*_up*MQ..*_ga*NjQwNDA2NDY0LjE3MDEwMzQzODM.*_ga_VM3STRYVN8*MTcwMTAzNDM4Mi4xLjAuMTcwMTAzNDM4Mi4wLjAuMA..) from 33 backers.
All this data underscores the importance of cross-chain communication in the current landscape.

But with so many bridging protocols available, what makes LayerZero stand out? In this blog, I will share everything I've learned while researching LayerZero.

This blog post is the first in a series where I will attempt to understand how different blockchain bridging protocols work. By clicking on the ***Blockchain Bridging*** tag, you can view other posts on the same topic.

## LayerZero Overview

> LayerZero is an omnichain interoperability protocol designed for lightweight message passing across chains. LayerZero provides authentic and guaranteed message delivery with configurable trustlessness.

LayerZero is not a blockchain; it is a protocol. Much like how HTTPS facilitates secure data packet transfers between servers on the internet, LayerZero aims to provide a straightforward method for connecting two blockchain networks. This enables the seamless transmission of arbitrary data between them. In essence, LayerZero can be utilized to link both EVM chains and EVM with non-EVM chains.

### But how does it works?

Before we can dive deep into how the protocol works, it is important to understand a couple of key concepts:

1. [User Application](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/faq/faq-1#what-is-a-user-application): A User Application (UA) is any contract that uses LayerZero to send and receive messages between blockchains.
2. [LayerZero Endpoint](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/faq/layerzero-endpoint): In LayerZero, messages are sent and received by LayerZero Endpoints, which handle message transmission, verification, and receipt. These endpoints consist of two components: a collection of versioned messaging libraries, and a proxy to route messages to the correct library version.
3. [Ultra Light Node](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/faq/faq-1#what-is-an-oracle): An Ultra Light Node is an official LayerZero endpoint library.
4. [Oracle](https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles): Oracles provide a method for the decentralized Web3 ecosystem to access existing data sources.
5. [Relayer](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/ecosystem/relayer): Relayers are responsible for relaying messages from one chain to another.
