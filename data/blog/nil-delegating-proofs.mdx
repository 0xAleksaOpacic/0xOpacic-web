> Note: If you haven't already, I recommend checking out [Part 1](https://0x-opacic-web.vercel.app/blog/nil-my-first-zk-ciruit) of this series. It covers the basics of creating and locally generating Zero Knowledge proofs using the =nil; Foundation toolchain.

## Introduction

Welcome to Part 2 of our series on Zero Knowledge proofs and the =nil; Foundation toolchain. 
In our first article, we covered the basics of creating a Zero Knowledge (ZK) Circuit and generating a proof for it on a local machine using =nil; toolchain. 
However, some circuits might be too complex or demanding for a standard PC to handle effectively. In some cases, your machine might not be powerful enough, 
or it may not generate the proof quickly enough to meet your needs. This is where the =nil; Foundation's Proof Market comes into play.

## =nil; Proof Market

The =nil; Proof Market acts like a bridge connecting those who need Zero Knowledge proofs with those who can produce them. 
It's essentially a marketplace for non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, which are typically compute-intensive and can take hours to generate.
At its core, the Proof Market is a solution for outsourcing. It allows anyone to request a zkProof, and then a network of specialized proof producers respond to these requests. 
This setup creates a free, open, and self-sustaining market, where the needs for complex proof generation are met by those with the resources and expertise to produce them efficiently.

> Note: Currently, Proof Market accepts circuits generated using the zkLLVM compiler and based on the Placeholder proof system. In the future it will support various proof systems

I strongly encourage you to take your time and go through the [official documentation](https://docs.nil.foundation/proof-market/). It covers everything you need to know to know about a Proof Market.

## Let's try 

Remember the `"is_even"` circuit we played around with in [Part 1](https://0x-opacic-web.vercel.app/blog/nil-my-first-zk-ciruit)? We're going to take another crack at it, but this time, we're going to use the =nil; Proof Market to do the heavy lifting for us.


#### Circuit code (main.cpp):

```c
#include <cstdint>

[[circuit]] bool is_even(uint32_t a) {
    bool res = (a % 2 == 0);

    __builtin_assigner_exit_check(res);

    return res;
}
```

#### Input (main-input.json):

```json
[
  {"int": 12}
]
```
